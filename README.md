A simple SvelteKit app to monitor symptoms and body scan.
I'm making this app to monitor a number of health issues I'm happing on a regular basis and see if I can associate them with certain foods or activities.

I'm intentionally developing it so it should be easy to throw up on [Railway](https://railway.app), [Netlify](https://netlify.com) + a DB a Raspberry Pi or something.
